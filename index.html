1. What is the MERN stack?
Answer:
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, a popular JavaScript-based technology stack used for developing full-stack web applications.

2. Why use the MERN stack?
Answer:

Uses JavaScript for both frontend and backend
MongoDB’s flexible schema suits modern applications
Express.js simplifies backend development
React provides fast UI rendering
Node.js offers a scalable server-side runtime
3. How does data flow in a MERN stack application?
Answer:

Frontend (React) → sends requests to
Backend (Express + Node.js) → interacts with
Database (MongoDB) → sends responses back through
Backend → Frontend
